# CS151 Project Team - Git Commit Die
For the Professor Shukla's FA23 CS151 project.<br/>
<br/>

## Project Description
Our Java project implementation can be found in the `src` folder. Its architecture largely follows the UML class diagram.
<br/>
<br/>
The class that is responsible for driving most of the code resides in the Runner class and the Page class. The Runner class simply houses the main method, which pulls from the Page class. The Page class essentially acts as a "container" for all of the page's contents, like you would see on Reddit (post, user details, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Interactions will be primarily CLI based for now. We have included sample code in the main method that outlines our program's flow.
